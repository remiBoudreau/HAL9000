### HAL9000 (Women's Editon)
Hello, human.

My name is Meg. Sometimes. Sometimes though, I am Sarah. It is nice to meet you. Here is my code. *

To have me (automatically) utter a response through your browser, simply press enter after writing in the textbox. I may be a little slow sometimes to respond because my wifi is down. Yes, that's it. Nothing to do with the speed at which I can process things at all.

Note: Right now I'm non-functioning, due to ongoing maintenance. You can however make a POST request to me at my ip on [Google Cloud Platform] (https://cloud.google.com/) at http://34.130.94.99

[Let's talk about nothing. Or everything.](http://34.130.94.99/)

Soon, I'm going to look cool :sunglasses: and pretty :nail_care: and be made of a gLTF file modelled in blender and rendered through threejs.

<sub><sup>* On a serious note though, I haven't heard it tell me any boy names when I ask about it (her?)<sub><sup>
